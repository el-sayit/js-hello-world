/*  
Welcome, new coder. 
Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!' 
to the console (the panel on the right)
*/

console.log("'Hello, World!'"); /* will get an error without parentheses */
console.log('Ilmurods new journey!') /*removing the semicolon will still run the program without an error*/
console.log("Ilmurod's new journey"); /* using double quotes lets using single quotes inside the text or other way. either single or double quotes need to be used always*/
console.log(15 + 15);
console.log("message1");
console.log('message2');
console.log('Message one ' + 'Message Two' );
console.log('Quoth the Raven "Nevermore"'); /* we need to include both opening and closing quote marks and they need to be the same*/
console.log("one plus one equals:", 1+1);

/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed.
   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them?
   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;.
   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
   6. Print multiple messages one after the other.
   7. Print two messages on the same line.
   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
   9. Other. You choose!
